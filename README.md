# Recipe Webpage Project

This project is a beginner-friendly static website showcasing a collection of recipes, including Handkerchief Lasagna, Greek Steak Marinade, and Chicken Shawarma. Each recipe is presented on its own HTML page with a clear structure including descriptions, ingredients, and step-by-step preparation instructions.

The website is built using semantic HTML and is designed for clarity, simplicity, and readability. Navigation between pages is made easy with internal links.
